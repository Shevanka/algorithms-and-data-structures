# Linked List – Mindmap

## Linked List
- Linear Data Structure
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Non-contiguous memory

---

## Node Structure
- Data
- Pointer
  - Next (Singly)
  - Prev + Next (Doubly)

---

## Types
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

---

## Operations

### Traversal
- Start from head
- Continue until NULL

### Insertion
- At beginning
- At end
- At specific position

### Deletion
- First node
- Last node
- Specific node

---

## Pointers
- Head pointer
- Current pointer
- Temporary pointer

---

## Memory Management
- Dynamic allocation
- Deallocation (free/delete)
- Avoid memory leaks

---

## Complexity
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insert/Delete (known position): O(1)

---

## Applications
- Stack
- Queue
- Graph adjacency list
- Polynomial representation

---

## Common Issues
- Null pointer access
- Memory leak
- Losing node reference
