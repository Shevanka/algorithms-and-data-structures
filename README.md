# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository documents my learning journey in Algorithms and Data Structures.

It was initially created to collect academic mindmap assignments, where submissions were limited to plain text forms. To preserve the actual learning artifacts, the work was stored and organized here as files. Over time, this repository evolved into a structured learning and reference repository.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning log for algorithm and data structure concepts
- A reference for implementations and complexity analysis
- Academic documentation of coursework materials
- A professional portfolio demonstrating problem-solving fundamentals

## Repository Structure

- `concepts/`  
  Theoretical materials including mindmaps, explanations, and conceptual notes.

- `implementations/`  
  Reference implementations of algorithms and data structures with clean and readable code.

- `tests/`  
  Simple test cases and example executions (where applicable).

- `docs/`  
  Supporting documentation such as complexity notes and terminology.

- `submissions/`  
  Archived academic submission context to preserve learning traceability.

## Topics Covered

- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs)
- Graph Traversal
- Recursion and Divide-and-Conquer
- Dynamic Programming (in progress)

## Design Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Explicit time and space complexity analysis
- Concept-first, implementation-second approach
- Consistent structure across topics

## Notes

Some materials were originally created for academic submissions and are intentionally retained to reflect the learning process and progression.
See `roadmap.md` for a detailed, RPS-aligned learning plan.
